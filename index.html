<h1 style="font-size: 35px;"> <strong> Information about me, <em>Assignment One.</em> </strong> </h1>


<h2> <strong>Ideal Job </strong> </h2>

<p> <ul> <li> Cyber analyst, software engineer, Programmer.</ul> </p>

<h2> <strong> Why are these an Ideal job? </strong> </h2>

<p> <ul> <li> I have always used computers since I was about 8 years old.
      I always played games and built computers for fun.
      After finishing school I really did not know what I wanted to do and I ended up working my way up through retail and being an Assistant Store Manager and Department Manager.
      I have always had a interest in Formula 1.
      Besides sharing this interest with my father, I am not what someone would call a “car person”.
      In fact, I don’t care about what car I drive or what other people drive. My interest in formula 1 is that the cars and the teams are state of the art. Always innovating. Trying new things to make the car steer better and go faster.
      They don’t achieve this just by the engine, its all about the car design the weight of the car the aerodynamics and so on.
      These teams always need programmers for their software. Even if it's just for simulation days. They need network admins and security to protect their Intellectual property from other teams using something they have made and are gaining an advantage from.
      Another aspect is a cyber analyst for the government. I am someone who is Australian through and through, I have a sense to protect my country and it is a dream of mine to be able to do so.
      I choose cyber analyst because I believe that the next global conflict will be based around computers before any physical conflict. </ul> </p>

  <h3 style="font-size: 20px"> <strong> Why RMIT?</strong>  </h3>

        <p> <ul> <li> Well I am an online student and I would like to complete a degree in Information Technology, and then specialize in cyber security or programming.
          To be a cyber analyst, network administrator, programmer or software engineer you need a degree for a good majority for the jobs.
          This is why I wish to study, to gain the knowledge I need and have access to experts in the industry of I.T. </ul> </p>

  <h3 style="font-size: 20px"> <strong> What gave me interest in I.T? </strong> </h3>

  <p> <ul> <li> I have always been around technology, my dad is a radio enthusiast, we have a radio antenna taller than our two story house. My dads “radio room” has four or five computer screens.
   I guess growing up around that I always wanted to know what technology was behind my dads interest and how computers worked.
    This lead me straight to the gaming world in computers, all the games you could play and how I could speed up my computer to play those games and get more and more fps. </ul> </p>

    <h3 style="font-size: 20px"> <strong> What experience in I.T do I have? </strong> </h3>

    <p> <ul> <li>  I do not have any Job experience in I.T. The most I have with dealing with money in I.T would be building computers suited to my friends and families need. These people gave me a budget and would give me money to purchase the parts they needed and construct and setup the machine. This would be everything from a keyboard, mouse, monitor to the computer parts. The work experience I do have is in retail management. From this I have learnt how important it is to have a functional team, not just from a management standpoint but from an entire store standpoint as well. Having excellent communication allows everyone to be on the same page and have a clear direction and understanding of the task or tasks at hand and the way forward. </ul></p>

      <h3 style="font-size: 20px"> <strong> What do I want to gain from RMIT? </strong> </h3>

      <p> <ul> <li>  From RMIT I want to gain the knowledge I need to achieve my goals. I want to be able to defend systems from cyber attacks, program my programs for anything or at least have the knowledge in how I can start to achieve this. </ul></p>

        <h3 style="font-size: 20px"> <strong> Something extra about me? </strong> </h3>

        <p> <ul> <li> A bit more of background on myself is, I played sport from the age of seven to eight years old. Until I was seventeen years old. I played basketball as a point guard and I played almost everyday of the week, most weekends I would play between three to four games all at separate stadiums as well as train and play more games during the week. I would be a leader on the court, running team plays, giving other players confidence to take an opportunity when they are open for it. I was known for my defensive skills, ball control, ability to read and run a play. I would call out our defense strategy on the court in real time, back myself and the team in. I learned to be a referee of the sport as well. I would always play right on the edge sometimes being fouled out. I would play aggressive but fair, with mind games involved as a separate aspect of game to get in my opponents heads.  </ul></p>

           <h3 style="font-size: 20px"> <strong> Pre-Job potential tests </strong> </h3>
<p>
What do these results mean to me? </P>

<p><ul><li> To be honest I think they hit the marker bang on in some areas such as logical thinking, in a way such as I will always think about the issue at hand and not just try to solve the issue but stop the issue from reoccurring. In forming a team and my behavior towards a team I think my current method is okay. I am okay with being myself and everyone being their selves. I am happy to take in what people are saying and will speak up when needed. When I was a manager in retail I would do exactly this except I would listen to what my team members would have to say and then judge by the most logical outcome.
